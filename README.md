----------------------------------

Volvor is a deck EV simulator for Flesh & Blood that estimates rough card values 

and attempts to string hands together and play them in a way to maximise EV.

----------------------------------

V0.0.1

Many things are currently not working as intended but the basic framework is 

able to complete calculations over many iterations without breaking and return

somewhat accurate value estimations.

----------------------------------

TO DO:

-Frontend

-Expand card pool

-Fix broken interactions

-Figure out how to do Enlightneded Strike correctly

-Blue modes on cards (i.e throwdagger) not working as intended
